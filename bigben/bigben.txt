Do the Big Ben, man! Every hour on your soundblaster under OS/2!

                                                     Aachen, den 14.12.92

Hi!

I'm a proud owner of a soundblaster card since a week now.

Naturally I searched through all BBS and FTP servers for something to 
feed this cute addition to my system.

This package you got now is nothing special, it just combines some nice
files I found and a little launcher of my own to produce some fun! :)


It contains:

    makefile    makefile for use with the emx port of GNU C++
    bigben.cc   C++ source of the BigBen launcher
  * emx.dll     runtime DLL from emx 0.8e
    bigben.exe  BigBen executable (still needs emx.dll)
  # player.exe  voc player 
  # sbos2.sys   soundblaster driver for OS/2 2.0
    bigben.voc  Big Ben himself


(*) token from the emx-0.8e distribution by Eberhard Mattes
(#) token from the sbos2v09.zip archiv by Michael Fulbright


Both packages can be found at least on the internet FTP server 
hobbes.nmsu.edu and will be certainly offered by any serious OS/2 BBS (e.g.
the Fernwood filenet members).

If you don't already have them - change that! Highly recommended!


To get BigBen started:

a) emx.dll

   copy emx.dll to a directory mentioned by the LIBPATH statement in your
   config.sys


b) sbos2.sys

   copy sbos2.sys to your sb directory. I use c:\sound\sbos2 on my system.

   Add "device=c:\sound\sbos2\sbos2.sys IRQ7 ADDR220 SBREG" to your
   config.sys. (Omitt SBREG if you use a SB Pro etc. See: sbos2 docs)


c) reboot & run BigBen

   BigBen will run at lowest priority and should issue a "player bigben.voc"
   every time the hour changes.


Enjoy!


Bye, Marc    (Marc_van-Woerkom@ac3.maus.de)
