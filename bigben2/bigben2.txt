   Do the Big Ben, man! Every hour through your sound device under OS/2!

Hi!

Exactly one year ago I wrote the first version of this little fun programm
which plays the sound of Big Ben every full hour.

In the meantime OS/2 evolved further.
Especially the Multimedia Presentation Manager (MMPM) is now part of the box
since OS/2 2.1.

Like it or not -- it's the way to make noise now.

So this is kind of an answer. :-)


What's new?
-----------

* Uses MMPM/2 to play the .wav file (using REXX and the MCI interface)
* Uses a PM timer for minimal CPU time usage (You shouldn't feel it at all!)
* Uses a .wav which has been sampled quite cleaner than the former .voc


The bigben2.zip archive contains:
---------------------------------

    makefile      makefile for use with the emx port of GNU C++
    bigben2.cc    C++ source of the Big Ben launcher
  * dingdong.cmd  REXX procedure which does ... well? :-)
    bigben2.def   definition file
    bigben2.doc   this doc
  * bigben2.exe   bigben2 executable (an OMF .exe - no emx.dll needed)
    bigben2.ico   a disaster of an icon (so ugly that it makes me proud)
  * bigben.wav    Big Ben himself in .wav format

An asterisk (*) indicates a necessary file

-> Thanks to Eberhard Mattes and the FSF for the cute compiler.


To get bigben2 started:
-----------------------

a) Install the MMPM if you didn't have it done already

b) copy the contents of this archive in some dark corner of your harddisk

c) call it from the drive icon (or dump it into the startup folder)

Enjoy!
